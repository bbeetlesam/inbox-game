# Inbox

> _Don’t ever let your heart empty — **devils** might try to fill it._

_Inbox_ is a short narrative-driven psychological horror game set entirely within a simulated **Windows 98**-like desktop. You play as a man stuck in a decaying routine — meaningless work, a distant mother, and a life lived through an old CRT screen. He's alone, ignored, and quietly losing his grip.

Then one day, a new message appears on **NetMatch**, a popular dating app at the time. It's from a _**woman**_ — kind, curious, and oddly consistent. As their chats grow deeper, his world begins to change. Or maybe it's unraveling. You explore the system: reply to messages, check old files, tweak settings. But with every interaction, something feels increasingly... off.

What starts as a digital connection begins to blur into something else entirely. Something that's watching. Or maybe waiting.

The story unfolds over `seven` in-game nights, each marking a new chapter in their digital relationship.\
With every new day, the desktop distorts — subtly at first, then with unsettling intensity. The more you talk to her, the more the system responds.\
But not everything inside this machine is synthetic.

## Features

- Simulated Windows98 UI themes, with pixel-perfect nostalgia — and just a bit... off.
- Functional main apps: **Chat App**, **NetMatch**, **File Explorer**, and **Settings**.
- Working **taskbar and Start menu**, just like the good ol' times.
- Customizable wallpaper color and game brightness.
- Authentic **retro shaders** — CRT-like curvature, distortion, grainy screen, and unease baked in.

## Installation

1. Install [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) framework (**v11.5** or later).
2. Go to the root folder where `main.lua` is located, and type `love .` on terminal.

Or, you can install it straight from _Inbox_'s [itch.io](https://bbeetlesam.itch.io/inbox) page.\
(There will be no updates on it until the game is finished. Instead, install from here if you want recent version.)

## How to Play

- **Navigate the desktop** and apps using your mouse, just like a classic Windows 98 mechanism.
- Use the **NetMatch** to find _people_ to connect with people of your type — or so it says.
- Use the **Chat App** to talk. People there are all humans... until they aren't.
- Use the **File Explorer** to browse old files — some might not belong there.
- Access the **Settings** app to adjust brightness, volume, and desktop color.
- You may only progress to the next day by clicking **Shut Down** from the start menu when prompted.
- There is **no save**, **no pause**. The system remembers.
